Synopsis: 

This web application allows users to make good use of the current ingredients in their fridge, and turn them into delicious recipies! 
A registered user can input the ingredients in their fridge and we will output recipes they can construct based on their input plus or minus a few other ingredients. 

Users can save recipies by adding them to their favorites for future use or to craft again.
On top of our service, users can leave reviews for the community based on the recipe they crafted. Together the community can write and read reviews based on the recipies found using our service. 

We hope you get cooking !
